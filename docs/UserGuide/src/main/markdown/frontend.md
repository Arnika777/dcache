Chapter 2. Frontend
===================

The frontend is an HTTP endpoint that provides a REST API.  REST is a
design principal, rather than a specific protocol, and the REST API
that frontend provides is non-standard.  This allows you to take
advantage of some dCache advance features that are not available
through other protocols.
